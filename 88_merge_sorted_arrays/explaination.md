This C++ code defines a class `Solution` with a function `merge`, which takes two sorted arrays (or vectors) `nums1` and `nums2` and merges them into a single sorted array within `nums1`. The array `nums1` has additional space at the end to accommodate the elements of `nums2`.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of each part of the code:

### Headers and Namespace

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;
```

- `#include <iostream>` and `#include <vector>` are included to allow the use of input/output streams and the `vector` container, respectively.
- `using namespace std;` allows us to use standard library components like `cout` and `vector` without prefixing them with `std::`.

### The `Solution` Class and `merge` Function

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        int k = m + n - 1;  // Last index of nums1's total space
        int i = m - 1;      // Last index of nums1's actual elements
        int j = n - 1;      // Last index of nums2's elements
```

- `class Solution`: Defines a class named `Solution`.
- `void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n)`: A public function within the `Solution` class that takes two vectors `nums1` and `nums2` along with two integers `m` and `n`.
  - `nums1` is a reference to the first sorted vector, which contains `m` valid elements followed by `n` extra spaces (initialized to 0) to hold elements from `nums2`.
  - `nums2` is a reference to the second sorted vector, containing `n` valid elements.
  - `m` and `n` are the number of valid elements in `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.
- `int k = m + n - 1;` sets `k` as the index for placing merged elements at the end of `nums1`, utilizing its total size (`m + n`).
- `int i = m - 1;` and `int j = n - 1;` initialize `i` and `j` to point to the last valid elements in `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.

### Merging Process

```cpp
        // Merge in reverse order
        while (j >= 0) {
            if (i >= 0 && nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
                nums1[k] = nums1[i];
                i--;
            } else {
                nums1[k] = nums2[j];
                j--;
            }
            k--;
        }
    }
};
```

- **Reverse Merging Strategy**:
  - The function iterates backward through `nums1` and `nums2`, starting from their respective last valid elements.
  - This approach is efficient because `nums1` has extra space at the end, so merging from the back prevents overwriting elements that are yet to be compared.

- **Inside the `while` Loop**:
  - `while (j >= 0)`: The loop runs as long as there are elements remaining in `nums2` (i.e., `j >= 0`).
    - **Condition `if (i >= 0 && nums1[i] > nums2[j])`**:
      - Checks if `nums1[i]` is greater than `nums2[j]`. If true:
        - The larger element (`nums1[i]`) is placed at `nums1[k]`, and `i` is decremented to point to the previous element in `nums1`.
      - **`else` Clause**:
        - If `nums2[j]` is greater than or equal to `nums1[i]`, or if `i < 0` (meaning no elements are left in `nums1` to compare), then `nums2[j]` is placed at `nums1[k]`, and `j` is decremented to move to the previous element in `nums2`.
    - **Decrement `k`**:
      - After placing an element in `nums1[k]`, `k` is decremented to the next available position from the back.

### Example Execution

Consider `nums1` and `nums2` as follows:

```cpp
nums1 = [1, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0], m = 3
nums2 = [2, 4, 6], n = 3
```

1. Start with `k = 5`, `i = 2` (pointing to `5`), and `j = 2` (pointing to `6`).
2. Compare `nums1[i]` (5) with `nums2[j]` (6):
   - `nums2[j]` (6) is greater, so `nums1[5] = 6`, then decrement `j` to 1 and `k` to 4.
3. Compare `nums1[i]` (5) with `nums2[j]` (4):
   - `nums1[i]` (5) is greater, so `nums1[4] = 5`, then decrement `i` to 1 and `k` to 3.
4. Continue this process until all elements from `nums2` are merged into `nums1`.

After the merge, `nums1` becomes:

```cpp
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

This method sorts `nums1` in-place, with elements merged in non-decreasing order.
